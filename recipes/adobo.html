    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    
        Adobo is an ubiquitous dish in the Philippines. You can pretty much use any meat you want in Adobo. 
    But my favorite would be the chicken adobo which is what are going to cook here.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken legs</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>bay leafs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned â€“ about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.
        </li>
        <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
        <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
        <li>oat chicken in glaze then serve over rice</li>
    </ol>
